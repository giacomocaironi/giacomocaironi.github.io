It is time consuming and often there are people out there who have already built something better. However when I started looking to static site generators to build my personal site, I found out that getting exactly what I wanted wasn't a trivial task. Using one generator would have required me to write a custom plugin to have the urls properly set, to use another I would have to write custom code just for having something other than a blog. The last one, who had almost anything I wanted (but anyway had all the features I really needed) used a templating language I absolutely didn't like. So instead of using one of these tools I decided to build my own.</content><link href="https://giacomocaironi.github.io/blog/posts/why-I-built-my-own-static-site-generator/" rel="alternate"/></entry><entry><id>https://giacomocaironi.github.io/projects/kart/</id><title>Kart</title><updated>2020-03-21T12:00:00+00:00</updated><content>A very flexible static site generator written in python</content><link href="https://giacomocaironi.github.io/projects/kart/" rel="alternate"/></entry></feed>
