[Toykoin](https://github.com/giacomocaironi/toykoin) is, as the name suggests, a toy cryptocurrency. I developed it to understand about the inner functioning of a cryptocurrency node. It is still in beta, but I plan on using it as material for a crash course about implementing a blockchain from scratch in python.
