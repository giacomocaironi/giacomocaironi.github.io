In early 2020 I took a blockchain and cryptography course at University of Milan Bicocca. It sparked my interest in the blockchain technology. So I started getting involved. Next is a more detailed description of what I have done in this field

## btclib

Btclib is a library developed by [Ferdinando Ametrano](https://ametrano.net), the teacher who held the course cited before. I started working on it at the start of the summer, and a month I finished the implementation of blocks, transactions, and PSBT parsing. I also worked at an implementation of a consensus-valid segwit signature hash. I am still working on btclib, especially on sighash and an experimental branch of taproot, which, at the time of writing(2020), has not been accepted yet in Bitcoin. After [Ferdinando Ametrano](https://ametrano.net), I am the biggest contributor to the library


## toykoin

[Toykoin](https://github.com/giacomocaironi/toykoin) is, as the name suggests, a toy cryptocurrency. I developed it to learn about the entire stack of a cryptocurrency node structure. It is still in beta, but I plan on using it as material for a crash course about implementing a blockchain from scratch in python.
