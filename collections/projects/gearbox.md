I designed a 3d gearbox with two of my classmates for a school project. We weren't able to finish it in time, so I took my time to redesign it to make it better. I still haven't finished it tough

The project is currently hosted [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a5e676a024d29df82bf9143e/w/f65c85d62b71e919f31845a8/e/6cde4d14ecf5a11af6a2b5a9)
