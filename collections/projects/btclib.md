Btclib is a library developed by [Ferdinando Ametrano](https://ametrano.net), the teacher who held the course cited before. I started working on it at the start of the summer, and a month I finished the implementation of blocks, transactions, and PSBT parsing. I also worked at an implementation of a consensus-valid segwit signature hash. I am still working on btclib, especially on sighash and an experimental branch of taproot, which, at the time of writing(2020), has not been accepted yet in Bitcoin. After [Ferdinando Ametrano](https://ametrano.net), I am the biggest contributor to the library
